## 🆘 Still Getting 404?

### Alternative Method: Deploy from Frontend Folder Directly

**Using Vercel CLI:**

```powershell
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Navigate to frontend folder
cd frontend

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

**Follow the prompts:**
- Set up and deploy? **Y**
- Which scope? **Select your account**
- Link to existing project? **N**
- What's your project's name? **mgnrega-tracker**
- In which directory is your code located? **./  (current directory)**
- Want to override settings? **N**

## 📋 Checklist Before Deploying:

- [ ] Deleted old Vercel deployment
- [ ] Using **"Import Git Repository"** method
- [ ] Selected `prathamesh-korde/MGNREGA-Tracker` repo
- [ ] **Set Root Directory to `frontend`** ⚠️ (MOST IMPORTANT!)
- [ ] Framework auto-detected as "Create React App"
- [ ] Clicked "Deploy"

---

## 💡 Why This Happens:

Your project structure:
```
mgnrega-tracker/          ← Vercel was looking here (WRONG!)
├── frontend/             ← Your React app is HERE! (CORRECT!)
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── public/
│   └── src/
└── backend/
```

**Solution:** Tell Vercel to use `frontend` as the root directory!

---

## ✨ After Successful Deployment:

You'll get a URL like:
- `https://mgnrega-tracker.vercel.app`

The site will work perfectly! 🎉
