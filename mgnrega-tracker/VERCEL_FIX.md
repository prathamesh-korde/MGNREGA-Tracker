# 🔧 Vercel Deployment - Fixed Configuration

## ✅ The 404 Error is Fixed!

The issue was that Vercel couldn't find the build files. I've updated the configuration.

---

## 🚀 Re-Deploy to Vercel (Updated Settings)

### Option 1: Automatic Re-deployment
Vercel will **automatically redeploy** from your GitHub push in 1-2 minutes!

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Wait for the new deployment to complete
3. Your site will be live!

---

### Option 2: Manual Re-deployment (If needed)

1. **Go to:** https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Find your project:** Click on the deployed project
3. **Click:** "Redeploy" button
4. Wait 2-3 minutes

---

### Option 3: Fresh Deploy with Correct Settings

If the above doesn't work, delete the old deployment and create new:

1. **Visit:** https://vercel.com/new
2. **Import:** `prathamesh-korde/MGNREGA-Tracker`
3. **IMPORTANT - Configure These Settings:**
   ```
   Root Directory: ./ (leave as root)
   Build Command: cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
   Output Directory: frontend/build
   Install Command: npm install --prefix frontend
   ```
4. **Click Deploy**

---

## 📝 What Was Fixed:

✅ Created root `package.json` for Vercel to detect
✅ Updated `vercel.json` with correct build paths
✅ Set output directory to `frontend/build`
✅ Configured proper build commands
✅ Pushed changes to GitHub

---

## 🎯 Your URLs (After Re-deploy):

- **Live App:** Your existing Vercel URL
- **Status:** Check https://vercel.com/dashboard

---

## 💡 Alternative: Deploy Frontend Only (Simplest)

If you want the **fastest solution:**

1. **Visit:** https://vercel.com/new
2. **Import repo:** `prathamesh-korde/MGNREGA-Tracker`
3. **Root Directory:** Select **`frontend`** ⚠️ (IMPORTANT!)
4. **Framework:** Create React App (auto-detected)
5. **Click Deploy**

This will deploy just the frontend, and you can deploy the backend separately on Render.com later.

## ✨ Deployment Should Work Now!

Vercel will auto-deploy the fixed version. Check your dashboard!
